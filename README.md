# Recommendation System for Movie Predictions

This project implements a Recommendation System utilizing Matrix Factorization and KMeans Clustering to predict and suggest movies to users based on their preferences and behavior. The system is trained on the MovieLens Dataset, a widely-used benchmark for recommendation systems.


- Matrix Factorization: Decomposes the user-item interaction matrix to uncover latent factors for personalized recommendations.
- KMeans Clustering: Groups similar users and movies to enhance recommendation accuracy.
- Movie Predictions: Provides tailored movie suggestions for individual users.
