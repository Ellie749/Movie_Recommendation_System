# Recommendation System for Movie Predictions

# Recommendation Systems Project

In this project, different recommendation systems are implemented to provide a comprehensive overview of all varieties of recommendation systems:

## 1. Content-Based
- **Traditional**
- **Machine Learning-Based**
- **Deep Learning-Based**

## 2. Collaborative Filtering
- **Traditional**
- **Machine Learning-Based** (includes model-based approaches)
- **Deep Learning-Based**

<!-- This project implements a Recommendation System utilizing Matrix Factorization and KMeans Clustering to predict and suggest movies to users based on their preferences and behavior. The system is trained on the MovieLens Dataset, a widely-used benchmark for recommendation systems.


- Matrix Factorization: Decomposes the user-item interaction matrix to uncover latent factors for personalized recommendations.
- KMeans Clustering: Groups similar users and movies to enhance recommendation accuracy.
- Movie Predictions: Provides tailored movie suggestions for individual users. -->
